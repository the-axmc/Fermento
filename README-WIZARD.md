# Sample Scaffold Project

This project demonstrates a basic Scaffold use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that initiates a Stellar Scaffold project with this contract. [Scaffold Stellar](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar?tab=readme-ov-file#scaffold-stellar) is a convention-over-configuration toolkit for blockchain and distributed application development on the Stellar network. It provides a seamless development experience through CLI tools, smart contract management, and deployment utilities.
